# The Dragon Reborn

## Overview

The Dragon Reborn is the third book in The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. The story follows multiple characters as they pursue different paths in a world on the brink of chaos.

## Initial Impressions

The book takes an interesting approach by focusing less on the main character and more on the supporting cast. This allows for deeper exploration of the world and other perspectives.

## What I'm Enjoying

- Rich world-building
- Complex magic system
- Multiple character perspectives
- Epic scope

## Progress

Currently about halfway through. The pacing is excellent and the plot threads are weaving together in intriguing ways.
